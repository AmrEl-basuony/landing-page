# Landing Page Project

Landing page is the conversion of a static page to a page that allows some sort of interaction.
Starter code taken from udacity [repo](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page).

This project has the scope of converting a static web page in a single interactive page.
It uses javascript to dynamically create navbar links based on the content, when a section is in the viewport it show the active state of that section.
During the scrolling the navbar is automatically highlighting the active section.
